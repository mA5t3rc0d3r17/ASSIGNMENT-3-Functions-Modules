# ASSIGNMENT-3-Functions-Modules

This repository contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate basic mathematical operations.

## Task 1: Factorial Calculation (task1.py)

This program calculates the factorial of a given number. 

### Features:
- Takes user input for the number
- Calculates factorial using a loop
- Returns a formatted string with the result
- Handles edge case (0! = 1) automatically

### Usage:
Run the script and enter a positive integer when prompted.

## Task 2: Mathematical Operations (task2.py)

This program performs three mathematical operations on a given number:
1. Square root calculation
2. Natural logarithm
3. Sine value (in radians)

### Features:
- Uses Python's built-in `math` module
- Takes single number input from user
- Calculates and displays all three operations
- Shows how to import and use standard library modules

### Usage:
Run the script and enter a positive number when prompted.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional packages needed (uses standard library)

## Notes
- For task2.py, note that the sine function uses radians, not degrees
- Negative numbers will work for task2.py (except for logarithm which requires positive numbers)
- Factorial in task1.py only works with non-negative integers
